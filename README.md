# Why Another Swagger Client library?

OpenAPI (fka Swagger) is a popular way to define and interact with RESTful systems. I work with
network engineers that are getting started with Python.  Network engineers are masters of
complex CLIs.  I've started using [ipython](https://ipython.org/) and Juptyer notebooks
as a way to *interactively* use Python to automate systems -- and this gives the user
as CLI look-and-feel.  I wanted to create a library that would allow them to *interactively*  
work with OpenAPI based system.  To do this, I combined the 
 client library with the  library in a way that provides
a very friendly and feature rich way to interact with these systems.  I will be creating a number of
tutorials using Jupyter notebooks to showcase these feature.  For now, here is a Quickstart
